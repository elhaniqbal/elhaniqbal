# üëã Hi there!, I‚Äôm [@elhaniqbal](https://www.github.com/elhaniqbal). Welcome to my GitHub page!


# ABOUT ME üòÑ
I am a second year international student from Bangladesh studying Integrated Engineering at the University of British Columbia! 
During my spare time, I enjoy learning about software development, autonomous vehicles, robotics and food!


# Technical Experience ü§ñ

## [UBC Uncrewed Aircraft Systems](https://www.ubcuas.com/) (September 2021 - Present) üõ©Ô∏è
### Software Developer & Administrative Member (September 2022 - Present) 
This is my current role at my design team where I help build software systems that help run our competition drones and aircraft. 
I am currently developing the front end of our new ground control stataion software using TypeScript and Svelte, and learning Django and Docker to build the backend. 

I also work as an administrative member where I help in the organization and execution of tasks and responsibilities such as sponsorship, engagement and management.

### Payload Systems Member (September 2021 - April 2022)
I worked as the payload systems member where I helped ideate and prototype concepts for a lightweight claw system that can attach to our main drone and pick up objects efficiently.
This was for the AEAC competition that took place in Southport, Manitoba. Through this role, I learnt how to use SolidWorks and make effective mechanical systems 
and also nourished my interpersonal skills such as teamwork and communication.

# Projects üíª

##  Current Projects üéØ

### The UkeBox (Team Project)
This is a capstone team project for a course where we are building a fully autonomous ukulele player from scratch. Users will be able to select songs using buttons and once the song is 
selected the system will play the melody of that song on the ukulele. I will be focusing mainly on the electrical and software aspect of this project while also help with some of the mechanical aspects and research. The link to the project will be provided upon completion.

### Portfolio Site (Personal Project)
This is a project I wanted to work on for a long time. I intend to use React and TypeScript to make a dynamic portfolio page. The project is currently in progress

## Past Projects ü¶æ

### [Health App](https://github.com/arafimam/HealthApp) (Team Project) 
I co-produced a full stack web application with [@arafImam](https://github.com/arafimam) that calculates user BMI and generates health reports based on calorie intake. I primarily worked on the front end and styled elements using Bootstrap and EJS and JavaScript. I added elements such as form validation and reorganized files for faster and efficient code. 

### Line Following Robot (Course Project)
I built a line following robot using an L298n motor driver, an Arduino Uno and QR1114 sensors. This project was part of a course where the goal was to learn how to use different electrical components and troubleshoot circuits. The project helped nourish my skills in soldering, circuit analysis and troubleshooting.

### [eatLocal](https://github.com/elhaniqbal/eatLocal) (Personal Project)
This is a full stack web application that allows user to review, add, update and delete restaurants of different cuisines. Its primarily intended for immigrants in North America who want a sense of home and can find restaurants that serve authentic local cuisine of their nationalities. I used JavaScript and frameworks such as MongoDB, Express and Mongoose to perform CRUD operations and basic error handling. 
I used Passport.js for authentication and authorization. The front end was built using EJS, Bootstrap, HTML/CSS. 

This course is special to me as this was my entry point to learning web development. The project is based on and inspired by the YelpCamp project by Colt Steele on Udemy. Despite being a learned project, I believe it requires a special mention as this project and the course taught me a lot about web development!

### Semi-Autonomous Claw (Team Project)
This was a team project for a course where we had to develop a claw system to automatically grab and hold onto objects of different shapes and sizes. We used an Arduino UNO, a sonar and a servo motor. I helped ideate and prototype different concepts and helped in construction of the final claw. I also aided in creating an effective e-poster using Office Suite to provide an overview of the project to all stakeholders.
