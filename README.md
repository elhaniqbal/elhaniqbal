# üëã Hi there! I‚Äôm [@elhaniqbal](https://www.github.com/elhaniqbal). Welcome to my Github page!


# ABOUT ME üòÑ
I am a third year international student from Bangladesh studying Integrated Engineering (and specializing in Computer and Electrical Engineering) at the University of British Columbia! 
During my spare time, I enjoy learning about software development, autonomous vehicles, robotics and food!


# Technical Experience ü§ñ
<details>
<summary> <h3> Tiger IT Bangladesh Ltd. (May 2023- August 2023) </h3></summary>
<br/>
### Software Engineer Intern
This was my first experience with the software industry. Furthermore, this was also my first experience with Machine Learning. I spent most of my internship getting introduced to machine learning. I performed extensive tests on different machine learning models to determine their applicability for real time inference. Furthermore, I spearheaded the development of a web app to perform action recognition on live camera feeds using TensorFlow, Flask, OpenCV and Python.

### Software Developer & Administrative Member (September 2022 - Present) 
This is my current role at my design team where I help build software systems that help run our competition drones and aircraft. 
I developed a ligthweight front end of our new ground control stataion software using TypeScript and Svelte and incorporated elements such as a QR scanner and set up endpoints to improve overall usage of competition software.
I am currently working on processing camera feeds to send to our machine learning model and also to other subsystems using Python
I also work as an administrative member where I help in the organization and execution of tasks and responsibilities such as sponsorship, engagement and management.

### Payload Systems Member (September 2021 - April 2022)
I worked as the payload systems member where I helped ideate and prototype concepts for a lightweight claw system that can attach to our main drone and pick up objects efficiently.
This was for the AEAC competition that took place in Southport, Manitoba. Through this role, I learnt how to use SolidWorks and make effective mechanical systems 
and also nourished my interpersonal skills such as teamwork and communication.

### Trash-E (Autonomous Underwater Trash Collection Robot) 
This is one of my most ambitious project yet. I am working on the software and electrical aspects of the project. I am currently using ROS for the main robot and using python to perform self navigation, trash detection and also controlling the movement mechanism. There are plans for an Android/iOS app. Via this project, I hope to gain extensive knowlege and expertise in ROS, integrating ML models and networking protocols such as TCP/IP and UDP. I also hope to gain experience with PCB design!

### Portfolio Site (Personal Project)
This is a project I wanted to work on for a long time. I intend to use React and TypeScript to make a dynamic portfolio page. The project is currently in progress.

### [The UkeBox üé∏](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwMDRXbq4SY)(Team Project)
This is a capstone team project for a course where we built a fully autonomous ukulele player from scratch. Users will be able to select songs using buttons and once the song is 
selected the system will play the melody of that song on the ukulele. I devised the power system which quadrupled operation time using buck converter and a laptop battery and performing extensive tests. I also worked on basic arduino code for the playing mechanism and followed the I2C communication protocol to set up communication between the user interface and the primary Arduino Mega. 

### 32-bit Integer Calculator (Course Project) 
This calculator was built using 8051 Assembly on a Altera DE0-CV board and can perform various functions such as addition, subtraction, division, multiplication and square root. I really enjoyed this project as it taught me about programming on a lower level!

### VHDL Alarm Clock (Course Project)
As part of my course, I also completed an alarm clock which I programmed using VHDL. This project was my first experience with HDLs(Hardware Description Languages)!

### [Health App](https://github.com/arafimam/HealthApp) (Team Project) 
I co-produced a full stack web application with [@arafImam](https://github.com/arafimam) that calculates user BMI and generates health reports based on calorie intake. I primarily worked on the front end and styled elements using Bootstrap, EJS and JavaScript. I added elements such as form validation and reorganized files for faster and efficient code. 

### Line Following Robot (Course Project)
I built a line following robot using an L298n motor driver, an Arduino Uno and QR1114 sensors. This project was part of a course where the goal was to learn how to use different electrical components and troubleshoot circuits. The project helped nourish my skills in soldering, circuit analysis and troubleshooting.

### [eatLocal](https://github.com/elhaniqbal/eatLocal) (Personal Project)
This is a full stack web application that allows users to review, add, update and delete restaurants of different cuisines. Its primarily intended for immigrants in North America who want a sense of home and can find restaurants that serve authentic local cuisine of their nationalities. I used JavaScript and frameworks such as MongoDB, Express and Mongoose to perform CRUD operations and basic error handling. 
I used Passport.js for authentication and authorization. The front end was built using EJS, Bootstrap, HTML/CSS. 

This course is special to me as this was my entry point to learning web development. The project is based on and inspired by the YelpCamp project by Colt Steele on Udemy. This project taught me a lot about web development!

### Semi-Autonomous Claw (Team Project)
This was a team project for a course where we had to develop a claw system to automatically grab and hold onto objects of different shapes and sizes. We used an Arduino UNO, a sonar and a servo motor. I helped ideate and prototype different concepts and helped in construction of the final claw. I also aided in creating an effective e-poster using Office Suite to provide an overview of the project to all stakeholders.
